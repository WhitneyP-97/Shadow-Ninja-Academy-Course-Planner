TODO:

- make the plot pretty (add labels, color coded, etc)
- make the "Add" buttons in the search results work by calling the add course function onto the corresponding course
- edit css to make it more professional-looking
- make it able to load the courselist course.csv, and write course schedule to csv
- add a database for the courses
- machine learning to recommend courses that the user would likely do well in or like based on their past courses
- login/logout function so students can save their schedule
- add more courses to the csv file
- in the csv file or the courses dataframe, change the days of the week to integers 0-6 instead of MTWHFSU
